# MonteCarlo_localization_SLAM

This project was done as a part of the course ESE650 : Learning  in Robotics at UPenn. This project involves implementing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping based on Odometry data and 2D-Lidar scans. It uses MonteCarlo sampling and Particle filter to get the localization and generate the occupancy grid of the environment. The pipeline is shown below:
